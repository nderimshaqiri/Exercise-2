        The Arsenal squad which set a new unbeaten league record between May 2003 and October 2004 will live long in the memory and forever in the history books.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Gunners' historic run actually began amid the ruins of a failed Premiership bid. Arsenal shook off the disappointment of a home defeat against Leeds which handed Manchester United the title to thrash Southampton 6-1 at Highbury on May 7, 2003. No one had an inkling about what would follow.
    </p>    
 
    <p>
        Arsenal started the 2003/04 campaign in style with four straight wins but almost came unstuck at Old Trafford in game No 8 of their run. Ruud van Nistelrooy's late penalty cannoned off the crossbar and Arsenal escaped with a 0-0 draw. It was the closest shave of the entire 49-game sequence.

        After seeing his side beat AC Milan 2-1 to claim the Dubai Super Cup, Mikel Arteta headed to the post-match press conference to face the gathered media.
    </p>
    <p>
        The boss tackled questions about the trip, his youngsters, the returning players from the World Cup and the upcoming transfer window, and you can read every he had to say below:on his confidence in our younger players to see us through the final stages:
If we want to develop players, you have to expose them to different contexts, and today I thought it was a perfect contest to understand how they can compete, even though they are really young. We have to put them in those scenarios so that we can develop our players.

    </p>

     <p>
        on Ben White playing again:I’m very pleased, everybody has been giving him a lot of support and love which is what he needed. You know the reasons why he had to leave the camp, and we are delighted to have him back and have him in really good shape.

     </p>

     <p>
        on Thomas Partey returning: He played a lot [at the World Cup] and obviously he was disappointed at the way that he had to leave, but it happens to every nation when they go out, and it takes a few days to reset and start to focus on the team. The good thing we have is that everyone has been showing that they are desperate to get back, and they want to be ready as quickly as possible and it was great to have those two back today playing some minutes.
     </p>

     <p>
        on when he thinks he’ll have the rest of our players back:That’ll take a few more days. Granit is already here, and is training and willing to participate on the weekend, so we don’t have that many away now so that is a positive thing.
     </p>

     <p>
        on his assessment of the trip: We have to raise the standards. We discussed the things that we are doing really well, and it is not a coincidence the way we have been performing but if we want to challenge at the top, we have to improve certain things. We’ve been lucky because we’ve brought a lot of kids here, but what they have done is not only maintain the standards, but increase them, so I want to say thank you so much to them because they have been key in this camp to have a successful period in training and compete in the competition.
     </p>

    <p>
        on whether he has chatted to Ben White yet:I have been having conversations with every single player that went to the World Cup to understand where they are - not only me but all the players and the staff are trying to give support when someone needs it.
    </p>

    <p>
        on Morocco’s manager Walid Regragui attending a tactical seminar Mikel gave last year:The impact he’s having, he’s a total credit to them. What he is doing is amazing, and what he is transmitting is great, and it’s a really positive thing for world football to have an African team at the stage. They’re one of four very select teams in this World Cup.
    </p>

    <p>
        on stories questioning Ben’s character: 
        We can’t control that, but I know who Ben is, what he needs and what his character is and how happy we all are to have him at the club.
    </p>

    <p>
        on whether it matters that we won the trophy: 
        It is about trying to get everybody with the same purpose and the same objective. We have to refocus everybody because the World Cup is a big distraction, and you have to pay it respect because it is a huge competition, but for us at club level, we still have a lot of things to do in the season
    </p>
    <p>
        on if a player at the World Cup has caught his eye:There are a few, and a few national teams as well. A lot of things they are doing are very interesting and it shows where the game is going, where it is evolving, but as for players - I’ll keep that to myself!
    </p>

    <p>
        on the plans for the transfer window:We are looking and we are active in the possibilities. If we can find the players that will strengthen the team, we will try.
    </p>




    <h2> Arteta World Cup</h2>

    <p>
        The manager oversaw a 2-1 win over AC Milan to ensure we took the trophy with a maximum of eight points from the two games – including bonus points for triumphing in both penalty shootouts as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        And there was further good news as Ben White and Thomas Partey became the first players to get back to action with us after being in Qatar for the World Cup.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mikel said he was delighted with how they have reintegrated into the group.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s been very good, especially their reaction psychologically,” he said. “The players were all willing to come and stay in Dubai. Granit is here already around the place and is desperate to start playing so it’s been really good.
    </p>

    <p>
        “It happens in the summer as well when there are Euros or World Cups. You know you get players all the time coming at different stages and we have to adapt. We knew it, we tried to plan it and hopefully we can have the rest of them very soon.”
        
        The win over AC Milan marked the end of a ten-day training camp in Dubai, designed to get the team back up to speed for the resumption of the Premier League on Boxing Day against West Ham.
    </p>

    <p>
        A host of youth team players bolstered the traveling squad, and Mikel was delighted with the work the players go through in Dubai.
        
        “This win is a good way to close the stage and the camp. I think they've been absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much as well the boys they've been really helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
        “The under-18s, the 16s and 21s maintained the level and the standards that we need. I think we competed really well against a really, really good side.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “It was a great test for us against a very different opponent to Lyon that have put a lot of questions for us. I think overall we deserved to win the game and put in a really strong performance.”
